This website allows users to plan parties, invite people, and delete parties as hosts, and check all the parties that are unlisted, check invitations for listed parties, and use those invitations which expire once the user enters the party as party goers (or partyers, as we like to call them)

To compile, run "flask run" after downloading all of the files and databases

To use the website:

If you are a host of a party
1. Register to the party from the Host register page
2. Login using the username and password you set, from the Host login page
3. On the Host home page, you will see a list of parties you have created
4. If you want to create a party, click "Create a Party!" and access the Partyplanner page. There, enter all the information and click submit
5. If you want to invite people to a party, access the Invite page by clicking submit when creating a party or the invite button from the Host Home. Then, choose the party you're trying to invite people to from the drop down list of the listed parties you have created, and enter the partyer usernames of the people you want to invite. You can input multiple names at once as long as you separate them with commas.
6. To delete a party, click the "Delete a Party" button, and access the Delete page. There, choose the party you're trying to delete from the drop down menu, and click "Delete"

If you are a partyer
1. Register to the party from the Partyer register page
2. Login using the username and password you set, from the Partyer login page
3. On the Partyer Home page, you will see a list of parties you have been invited to and a list of unlisted parties that have been created
4. To enter a listed party, the bouncer at the party will watch you select the party from the drop down list and click "Enter". Be careful, once you enter a party, the party will be deleted from your listed party list to prevent users from recycling invitations to parties

* Make sure to Logout to switch from Host mode to Partyer mode and vice versa
* If shown an error message, go back to the previous page unless otherwise instructed
